Question:
    imagine you are developing a software package that requires the users to enter their own passwords. your software requires that users' passwords meet the following criteria:
        the password should be at least 6 characters long
        the password should contain at least 1 uppercase and at least 1 lowercase letter
        the password should have at least 1 digit
    write a program that asks for a password then verifies that it meets the stated criteria. if it doesn't, the program should display a message telling the user why
